## Description

Path planning is crucial for any robot or autonomous vehicle that needs to navigate through an environment. This repository is dedicated to the in-depth implementation details of various path planning algorithms. Rather than providing high-level, off-the-shelf algorithms, the content here dives deep into the mechanics and intricacies of each method. Primarily, this repo serves as my self-training platform, allowing me to understand and experiment with the underlying principles of each algorithm. Fellow learners and enthusiasts are welcome to explore, understand, and contribute to this knowledge journey.
 

## Algorithms Included

- **A***: A popular graph traversal algorithm.
- **Dijkstra**: A guaranteed shortest path finder.
- **RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees)**: Useful in more complex and dynamic environments.
